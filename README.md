# Change Userspace Font

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows the Userspace font to be changed to whatever font you want.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [ChangeUserspaceFont.dll](https://github.com/Raidrair796/Change-Userspace-Font/releases/latest/download/ChangeUserspaceFont.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

## Info
This is a fork of [Change-Userspace-Font](https://github.com/Hayden-Fluff/Change-Userspace-Font) that ports the mod to Resonite.
